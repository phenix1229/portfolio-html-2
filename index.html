        <h2>About me</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I have worked over 10 years in IT in desktop support. I recently made a switch to web development and am attending classes at Code Immersives. I enjoy puzzles, taking things apart, reverse engineering and reassembling them. I also enjoy riding my bike and walking around the city. I also have one furry, four-legged child.
